		<p>Hi there! My name is <a class="personal" href="http://vadimsbrodskis.com" target="_blank">Vadim Brodsky</a> (though officially its Vadim<strong>s </strong>Brodsk<strong>is</strong>, because thats how the Latvian language works). Some of you might know me by my Twitter handle <a href="http://twitter.com/jamiejakov">@jamiejakov</a> (<a href="http://jamiejakov.lv/2014/01/why-jamiejakov/">why jamiejakov?</a>). I was born in Riga, Latvia and have lived there for 17 years, after which I have come to Sydney, Australia to get a university degree and settle down. </p>
		<p>Currently working as a Associate Developer at <a href="http://www.wisetechglobal.com" target="_blank">WiseTech Global</a>. Recently <a href="http://jamiejakov.lv/2016/10/ive-graduated/">graduated</a> from the <em><a href="http://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c10239.html">BScIT BAIS</a></em> course in <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au" target="_blank">UTS</a> (University of Technology Sydney). Still webmaster of <a href="http://utsanime.net" target="_blank"><em>anime@UTS</em></a> and <a href="http://animesydney.org" target="_blank"><em>AnimeSydney</em></a>. And IT Director of <a href="http://smash.org.au" target="_blank"><em>SMASH!</a></em></p>

		<p>Love technology, anime, games, and traveling, so thats what I'm mainly going to blog about. I also swim and playing the trumpet (though I haven't had much time for that lately). Got into photography, so I hope you like my photos. Gaming wise - Overwatch, Hearthstone, Street Fighter, WoW, etc.</p>

		<p>Aside from that I know 5 languages (in the order that I learned them):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Russian</strong> - mother language</li>
			<li><strong>Latvian</strong> - country language, and all the subjects in school were taught in it</li>
			<li><strong>English</strong> - have been learning since I was 3 years old</li>
			<li><strong>German</strong> - learned it in school (around 7 years), haven't had any practice lately</li>
			<li><strong>Japanese</strong> - 8 or so years now, <a href="http://jamiejakov.me/life/jlpt-n2/">passed JLPT N2</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Hope this gave you an idea of who I am and what to expect.</p>

		<p>Please enjoy my blog.</p>

		<p>Vadim.</p>
